# Rubix-Cube

🧩 Rubik’s Cube Solver Web App
📖 Project Description

The Rubik’s Cube Solver is an interactive web application that allows users to manually input the colors of all six faces of a scrambled Rubik’s Cube and automatically generates a solution sequence.
The app visually demonstrates each solving step with smooth 3D cube animations, helping users understand how standard solving algorithms like Kociemba, BFS, and DFS work in practice.

⚙️ Key Features

🎨 Interactive Input Interface – Users can select cube colors for each of the six faces through a simple 3×3 grid.

🧠 Smart Validation – Ensures each color appears exactly nine times and prevents invalid cube states.

🔄 Undo / Redo Options – Allows users to easily correct color assignments before submission.

📊 Algorithmic Solution – Uses the Kociemba algorithm to compute the optimal solution sequence.

🎬 Visual Demonstration – Animates cube rotations step by step to visualize how the cube is solved.

💡 User-Friendly Design – Clean UI with menu options, clear/submit buttons, and visually appealing background.

🧠 Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Cube.js Library (Kociemba solver implementation)

Framer Motion / CSS Animations for smooth cube movement

🚀 How It Works

Input the cube’s colors one face at a time.

Ensure each color is used exactly nine times.

Click Submit to validate the cube.

The solver generates the solution sequence.

Watch the cube animate through the solving steps in real-time.

📈 Future Enhancements

Adding camera input to scan real cubes.

Support for 4×4 and 5×5 cube variations.

Voice-controlled cube input and solving assistant.
